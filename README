Dependencies:

Django 1.1
django_extensions
imagemagick
wvWare

Optional:

python-twitter
X-Sendfile support

Installation:

Copy local_settings.py.example to local_settings.py and customize.
Some of the apps have app-specific settings at the top of their models.py
  or views.py. You probably don't need to edit those anyway.
Be sure to make a production_settings.py (or similar) that turns off DEBUG
  and TEMPLATE_DEBUG, and switches the cache backend to memcached or such.
FastCGI recommended. See the Django website for more details.
